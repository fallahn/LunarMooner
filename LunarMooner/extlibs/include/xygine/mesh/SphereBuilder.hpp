    Z+, Z-

        \param radius Size in world units for the radius of the sphere
        \param resolution Number of quads per side. Defaults to 4 which
        is 4*4 per side, 6 sides = 96 quads for 192 triangles. Higher
        numbers result in a smoother mesh but increased triangle count.
        \param backface If this is true the 6th, rear-facing face is built.
        If a sphere is not likely to be rotated in a scene it can be optimised
        by not generating faces which will not be seen.
