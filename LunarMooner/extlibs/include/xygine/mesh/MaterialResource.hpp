        Materials should be added once to the resource mananger
        by providing an integer ID (mapped via an enum for example)
        and a shader to be used by the Material. Shaders should be
        ready initialised before being passed to this function, and
        must out-live any instances of the MaterialResource in
        which they are used. IDs can be any unsigned integer value
        except 0xFFFF which is reserved for the default Material.
        As Materials are shared between models on which they are
        used the return value from this function can be used for
        immediate configuration of the Material (assigning
        UniformBuffers or texture parameters for example) which
