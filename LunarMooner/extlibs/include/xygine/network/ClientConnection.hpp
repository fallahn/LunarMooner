        \brief Allows creating a connection to a server application running 'ServerConnection'.
        The client/server connection is maintained over UDP using challenge/response system to
        keep it alive. Packets are all ID'd and acknowledged by the remote connections so missing
        packets may be identified and resent if necessary. Using the Acknowledge ID it is also
        possible to determine packet order and discard out of date information. Connections
        allow the provision of custom packet handlers with custom IDs so that they are flexible
        enough to use in multiple applications, whilst still maintaining reliability.
