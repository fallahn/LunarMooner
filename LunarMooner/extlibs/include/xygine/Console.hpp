        registering objected is destroyed. This will lead to undefined behaviour
        when calling such a command. To help negate this commands can be registered
        with a pointer to the registering object:
        addCommand("close", myCommand, (void*)this);

        call to unregisterCommands((void*)this) will unregister all commands from
        the console, so that trying to execute them will result in defined (non)
