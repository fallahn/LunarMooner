    \brief A drawable component used to draw the 3D scene belonging to a MeshRenderer.
    Although the MeshRenderer can be drawn independently it is sometimes desirable
    to draw the 3D world within a specific layer in a Scene. This component can be
    attached to a node within a scene graph for this purpose. It is generally not 
    recommended to have more than one of these components in a Scene from a performance
    perspective as it will cause the entire 3D scene to be drawn multiple times. In
    these cases it's better to draw the MeshRenderer directly to another buffer such as
    an sf::RenderTexture, and then use that texture for a sprite placed within the Scene.
