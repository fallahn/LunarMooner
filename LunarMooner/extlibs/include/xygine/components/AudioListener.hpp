    \brief Audio listener component

    The audio listener component defines where in the scene
    the player's virtual ears are. Audio sources played in the scene
    are automatically panned relative to the listener position. The
    listener position also affects the falloff in volume of audio
    sources the further away they are from the listener. Usually
    the audio listener would be attached to the same entity as the
    active scene camera, or possibly the entity to which the player
    is attached. There can only ever be one instance of a listener
    in any scene, creating a new listener component automatically
    destroys any existing ones.
