    a single batch multiple Sprites can be created and attached to
    entities in a scene. Only the batch itself is drawable, so the batch
    must have its own entity. Multiple batches using different textures
    can exist in a single scene, so potentially hundreds of sprites can
    be drawn with only a few draw calls.

    which allows efficient drawing of multiple sprites in a single call
    potentially offering a large performance boost. A sprite component
    on its own will not work - it must be created via the addSprite()
    function of a SpriteBatch component.
