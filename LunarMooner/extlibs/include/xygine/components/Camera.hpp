    \brief Camera Component

    Cameras are used to define the view of the scene to be rendered
    on screen. The scene class contains a default camera, which can be
    overriden by attaching a camera component to an entity, and setting
    the scene's active camera to the component (see Scene class). Cameras
    attached to entities take on the entities transform, both translation
    and rotation. This allows a camera to easily follow a player or other
    in game entity.
