    \brief Particle System controller component

    The particle controller is a utility component for
    firing particle systems, recycling its resources as much
    as possible. Rather than create a new particle system
    each time one is triggered, the controller will look for
    existing inactive systems and use those. New systems are
    created only when none are available. A scene will normally
    only require a single controller attached to an entity in
    the scene. Particle controllers are then able to be triggered
    by sending a Command to its parent entity requesting a system
    be fired, or by adding custom message handlers. The controller
    is useful for creating effects such as explosions which maybe
    be repeated around the scene rather than particle systems 
    attached to specific entities such as trails.

        Particle Definitions allow creating preset particle systems
        either programatically, or via a loaded json file. When a
        definition is added to the controller it is paired with the
        given ID which can be used to identify a system when fired.
