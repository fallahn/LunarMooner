        parent entity. This is normally only needed when implementing
        a drawable component, but applies to any entity which may
        affect the parent entitiy spatially, such as custom collision
        components. Normally this returns the localBounds transformed
        by the component's transform if it has one, else it should
        return localBounds. NOTE Drawables *MUST* implement this
        as it is used in culling calculations when rendering. If a
        custom renderable component is not being drawn this is the
        first place to check. Global bounds can be visualised by
        enabling debug output of the Scene.
