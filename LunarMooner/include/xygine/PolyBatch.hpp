    a single texture or texture atlas which is used by all Polygons
    belonging to the same PolyBatch. PolyBatches must live at least as
    long as all the Polygons belonging to it, else modifying a Polygon
    will lead to undefined behaviour.

        Polygons can be individually set so that they can use subregions of the
        same texture. This reduces the amount of texture switching required to
        draw many different shapes.

        tell the PolyBatch to use no texture. As this is only a reference the

        to prevent running into the white-square problem.
